Drink Suggestion App

Base Features
Suggest variety of beer/wine based on preference
Preference can be either preferred alcohols or foods
I.e. Someone who enjoys dark chocolate would likely enjoy a Cabernet Sauvignon (wine) or stout (beer)
The app would likely be in the form of a questionnaire/checklist
As well as suggesting variety of alcohol, gives a few examples of the most popular brands of that variety
The program will use a database for all the varieties and brands.
Database could be an already existing website, or our own personally made database, depending on whether we can properly integrate someone elseâ€™s database
